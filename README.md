# Christmas-2021

This is a little something we at GDSC have created for our members to help them document their progress during the 2021 Christmas Holiday 

## Description
---
As an accountability excercise this repo is set up to help GDSC Covenant University members keep
their fingers warm during this holiday.  
A nice way to measure how far you've come against a target you have set for yourself 

## Getting Started
### Help
---
- Every member should create a folder with their **Github Name** as the name of the folder as this is how we would verify that you are making changes to only your folder. 
- Your first commit should be a txt file that clearly states what it is you plan to achieve by the end of the break.  
It could be anything, from the technologies you want to learn or the projects you want to build, or even a coding challenge you intend on completing
- Commits should be made at least once a week to your folder. You have free creative control over your folder and can do anything that shows you're getting closer and closer to your goal.  
### Contributing to this project
---
To make an acceptable pull request, you should:
- Fork the repo
- Make changes to your forked version of the repo
